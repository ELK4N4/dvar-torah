# dvar-torah
An api that generate every week "dvar torah" to the corrent week and print it to my printer
## Background
Every Friday I usually print a Dvar Torah for the Shabbat table. I have noticed that the action I perform is constant and every time I take from the same site, only the parameter that changes is the Parasha of the week. So I decided I would just make a program that would do it every Friday in my place :)
## How it works?
